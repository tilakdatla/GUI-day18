Python Turtle Graphics Challenges
This project contains four challenges that were completed using Python’s turtle graphics module. The turtle module provides a Screen class and various methods to create, control and manipulate the Turtle objects on a Screen.

Challenge 1: Drawing Shapes
In the first challenge, we use the turtle module to draw shapes with different numbers of sides, from a triangle to a decagon. Each shape is drawn in a different color.

Challenge 2: Random Walk
The second challenge is a random walk. Here, the turtle moves in a random direction at each step. The color of the path is also randomly chosen at each step, resulting in a colorful trajectory.

Challenge 3: Spirograph
The third challenge is to create a spirograph. A spirograph is a geometric drawing toy that produces mathematical roulette curves. As with the previous challenge, the color of the drawing is randomly chosen at each step.

Challenge 4: Dot Painting
The fourth challenge is to create a dot painting. The turtle moves in a specific pattern, leaving behind a trail of colored dots. The color of each dot is randomly chosen from a predefined list of colors.

Libraries Used
turtle: This is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the “turtle”.
random: This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions including integer and float. We use it to generate random colors and random directions of movement.
